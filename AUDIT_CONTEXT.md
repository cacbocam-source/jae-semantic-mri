# SEMANTIC MRI PIPELINE — PROJECT STATE AUDIT

Version: 3.5  
Date: 2026-03-23  
Status: Canonical current-state handoff for continuation sessions

This document is the authoritative operational snapshot for the current repository state.

## Authority rules

- This file controls current-state interpretation.
- `RESEARCH_LOG.md` is the canonical chronological session log.
- `DEBUGGING_AUDIT_2026-03-22.md` is the authoritative engineering record for the stabilization cycle completed on 2026-03-22.
- `audit.md` is supplemental historical workflow and infrastructure history only.
- `METHODS_PIPELINE.md` is the current methods summary.
- `DATA_SCHEMA.md` and `SCHEMA_CONTRACT.json` are the current schema/contract summaries.
- If any conflict exists between this file and any supplemental document, this file controls unless this file explicitly delegates to a narrower authoritative contract.
- All repo-relative paths are assumed to resolve under:

```text
/Volumes/Clemons_Data/_Anchors/Research_Data/JAE_Legacy_Audit
```

- Do not assume a home-directory anchor path is authoritative unless it has been explicitly resolved to the same target.

## Ingestion and year resolution

The live corpus currently operates under two validated route layouts.

### Route_A_Modern
- file pattern: `data/raw/Route_A_Modern/<YEAR>.pdf`
- year resolution: filename-derived
- example: `2026.pdf → 2026`

### Route_B_Legacy
- file pattern: `data/raw/Route_B_Legacy/<YEAR>/<file>.pdf`
- year resolution: directory-derived
- example: `1960/<file>.pdf → 1960`

### Non-temporal artifacts

Some legacy artifacts do not resolve to a valid year (e.g., `Vol1_1.pdf`).

Operational rule:
- such files are excluded from manifest seeding and downstream processing
- they are not assigned a persisted sentinel year
- exclusion is explicit and logged during pipeline execution

### Year-resolution contract

Resolution precedence:
1. `manifest_row["year"]` when available
2. explicit legacy filename mapping from `data/manifests/legacy_filename_year_map.csv`
3. supported filename parsing from `bins/s04_utils/year_resolution.py`
4. fail fast if unresolved

Operational rules:
- unsupported filenames must not silently guess a year
- manifest year remains authoritative when available

---

## Computational philosophy

The pipeline is designed for:
- deterministic computation
- full reproducibility
- transparent mathematics
- auditability
- hardware-aware acceleration
- fail-fast validation at shared contract boundaries

The system intentionally avoids:
- black-box ML pipelines
- opaque vector frameworks
- undocumented tensor math
- silent fallback for route/year/schema drift

Approved scientific libraries for vector math:
- `numpy`
- `scipy.spatial.distance`

---

## Hardware environment

**Primary compute system**
- Apple Silicon M3 Max
- 64 GB unified memory

**Acceleration**

```python
DEVICE = "mps"
```

**Embedding model**

```python
MODEL_ID = "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5"
```

**Model properties**
- 768-dimensional embeddings
- 8192-token context window
- suitable for long scientific text

**Worker configuration**

```python
MAX_WORKERS = 8
```

## Current implemented state

### Phase 1 — Infrastructure
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Phase 2 — Extraction pipeline
**Status:** COMPLETE

Core modules:
- `digital_extract.py`
- `ocr_engine.py`
- `smart_extract.py`
- `cleaning.py`
- `segmenter.py`

### Phase 3 — Structured export
**Status:** COMPLETE

Core modules:
- `section_export.py`
- `orchestrator.py`

Implemented behavior:
- canonical top-level section export
- no nested `sections` payloads
- deterministic year resolution delegated to `bins/s04_utils/year_resolution.py`

### Phase 4 — Embedding generation
**Status:** COMPLETE

Implemented behavior:
- one schema-compliant embedding bundle per structured document
- stable `doc_id` derived from source PDF path
- storage mirrored under route/year hierarchy
- embedding bundle contract aligned to metrics loader

### Phase 5 — Route-level metrics
**Status:** COMPLETE AND VALIDATED

Implemented behavior:
- metrics generated from manifest-backed document years
- recursive embedding discovery supports flat and nested route structures
- route-level metrics persisted at:

```text
data/metrics/Route_A_Modern/metrics.npz
data/metrics/Route_B_Legacy/metrics.npz
```

#### Current validated temporal state

`Route_A_Modern`
- `epoch_count = 1`
- `epoch_labels = ['2025-2029']`
- `innovation_velocity_count = 0`
- valid singleton-epoch route artifact

`Route_B_Legacy`
- `epoch_count = 2`
- `epoch_labels = ['1960-1964', '1965-1969']`
- `innovation_velocity_count = 1`
- valid two-epoch route artifact

#### Current cardinality validation
- structured legacy artifacts: `149`
- embedding legacy artifacts: `149`

### Phase 6 — Interpretive analysis and reporting
**Status:** EXTENDED, VALIDATED, AND EXECUTING

Implemented surfaces:
- `bins/s06_analysis/loaders.py`
- `bins/s06_analysis/interpret.py`
- `bins/s06_analysis/report_builder.py`
- `bins/s06_analysis/figure_builder.py`
- `bins/s06_analysis/apa_table_builder.py`
- `bins/s06_analysis/apa_figure_builder.py`

#### Phase 6 output classes

**1. Descriptive summary outputs**

Generated under:
- `analysis_outputs/summaries/`

Current validated outputs:
- `Route_A_Modern_summary.md`
- `Route_B_Legacy_summary.md`

**2. Machine-readable table exports**

Generated under:
- `analysis_outputs/tables/`

Current validated outputs:
- `Route_A_Modern_epoch_summary.csv`
- `Route_A_Modern_innovation_velocity.csv`
- `Route_B_Legacy_epoch_summary.csv`
- `Route_B_Legacy_innovation_velocity.csv`

**3. Backend figure exports**

Generated under:
- `analysis_outputs/figures/`

Current validated outputs:
- `Route_A_Modern_epoch_dispersion.png`
- `Route_B_Legacy_epoch_dispersion.png`
- `Route_B_Legacy_innovation_velocity.png`

No Route A innovation-velocity backend figure is produced because `Route_A_Modern` contains only one validated epoch and therefore has no adjacent transition.

**4. APA manuscript reporting outputs**

Generated under:
- `manuscript/paper/tables/`
- `manuscript/paper/figures/`

Current validated APA table outputs:
- `Table_1_epoch_summary.md`
- `Table_2_innovation_velocity.md`

Current validated APA figure outputs:
- `Figure_1_epoch_dispersion.png`
- `Figure_1_epoch_dispersion.md`
- `Figure_2_innovation_velocity.png`
- `Figure_2_innovation_velocity.md`

#### Reporting rule

All data analysis reporting artifacts are governed by an embedded rule of **APA 7 compliance without exception**. This applies to manuscript-facing tables, manuscript-facing figures, and any future presentation-oriented Phase 6 reporting outputs.

---

## Current analytic interpretation boundary

Interpretation remains bounded by current corpus structure.

### Allowed
- route-internal epoch summaries
- route-internal dispersion comparison
- route-internal innovation-velocity inspection
- descriptive comparison of route structure
- manuscript-facing descriptive reporting under APA 7 constraints

### Not yet justified
- strong inferential claims about long-run trajectory
- strong cross-route causal claims
- publication-grade substantive interpretation beyond descriptive, scaffolded reporting

### Reason
- `Route_A_Modern` remains singleton
- `Route_B_Legacy` currently resolves into two epochs only
- current Phase 6 is a validated descriptive/reporting layer, not a full inferential layer

---

## Recovery / workload control

The core engine is now treated as frozen except for blocker fixes.

### Delegated or semi-delegated work
- manuscript identification
- raw PDF acquisition
- intake queue confirmation
- staging and batch QC

### Owner-controlled work
- final QC
- manifest integration
- pipeline execution
- artifact validation
- documentation closeout
- Phase 6 interpretation/readiness decisions

This remains the official workload-control model for preventing the project from expanding into an unbounded simultaneous scraper/engine/study workload.

---

## Operational next step

The next correct work surface remains **Phase 6 documentation and interpretation refinement**, not further pipeline repair, unless a new contradiction appears in validated artifacts.

Priority order:
1. synchronize authoritative and supplementary documentation
2. keep methods/schema docs aligned to the validated Phase 6 reporting stack
3. preserve APA 7 compliance across all manuscript-facing outputs
4. extend restrained interpretive analysis only within the validated descriptive boundary
5. avoid reopening infrastructure debugging without new evidence
